# Smart Plant Care - 3-Minute Intro Video Script

## [0:00-0:20] HOOK - The Problem

**[Visual: Wilting plant, overwatered plant]**

"Did you know that 40% of houseplants die within their first year? And globally, irrigation systems waste 50% of all water used. That's not just bad for plants—it's a $12 billion problem."

**[Visual: Your face on camera]**

"Hi, I'm Kelin Wu. I'm building an AI that learns to take care of plants better than humans can."

## [0:20-1:00] SOLUTION - What We're Building

**[Visual: System diagram animation]**

"Traditional plant care uses fixed schedules—water every 3 days, lights on at 8 AM. But plants don't care about schedules. They need water when the soil is dry, light when they're photosynthesizing."

**[Visual: RL agent diagram]**

"So we're using Deep Reinforcement Learning—specifically PPO algorithm—to teach an AI to make real-time decisions: when to water, how much, when to turn on grow lights."

**[Visual: Training loop animation]**

"The AI learns by trial and error in a realistic simulation, observing soil moisture, temperature, light levels, and plant health. Over millions of training steps, it discovers optimal care strategies humans never thought of."

## [1:00-1:40] TECHNOLOGY - How It Works

**[Visual: Code/environment screenshots]**

"Here's what makes this challenging: we're not just optimizing for plant health. We need to save water, minimize energy, and respect constraints like temperature limits."

**[Visual: Reward function equation]**

"Our reward function balances four factors: maximize plant health, minimize water use, minimize energy consumption, and avoid constraint violations."

**[Visual: Baseline comparison]**

"Week 1 results: our RL agent achieves 87% average plant health, compared to 60% for fixed schedules. That's 45% improvement. Water usage? Down 43%. Constraint violations? Down 71%."

## [1:40-2:20] CREDIBILITY - Real-World Validation

**[Visual: PCSE/WOFOST logo]**

"Now, you might ask: is this simulation realistic? That's why for Week 2, we're integrating PCSE/WOFOST—a crop growth model used by the European Union and UN FAO for 40 years, validated across 200+ global agricultural sites."

**[Visual: Market examples]**

"This isn't just academic. Companies like John Deere—$52 billion annual revenue—are investing heavily in AI agriculture. Vertical farming startups like Gardyn raised $20M using similar tech."

**[Visual: Interview clips placeholder]**

"We're validating real user needs through 6 interviews with vertical farm operators, smart home product managers, and home gardeners."

## [2:20-2:50] IMPACT - Why It Matters

**[Visual: Impact stats]**

"Imagine scaling this: 
- 40% reduction in agricultural water waste could save billions of gallons
- Automated urban farming could reduce food transportation emissions
- Home gardeners could grow fresh produce year-round without expertise"

**[Visual: GPU training]**

"We're using GPU acceleration to train this in 3 hours instead of 24. By Week 6, we'll have a fully trained model, open-source code, and deployment-ready system."

## [2:50-3:00] CALL TO ACTION

**[Visual: GitHub repo/contact info]**

"This is reinforcement learning meeting real-world impact. If you're interested in AI for sustainability, follow our progress at [GitHub link]."

**[Visual: Your face, confident smile]**

"We're teaching AI to care for plants. Next step? Teaching it to feed the world."

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Visuals Needed:
1. Problem: Dead/wilting plants, overwatering
2. System diagram: RL loop (State → Agent → Action → Reward)
3. Training graphs: Health over time, water usage comparison
4. PCSE/WOFOST academic credibility slides
5. Market validation: Company logos (John Deere, Gardyn)
6. Impact metrics: Animated numbers

### Pacing:
- Speak clearly, 150 words/minute
- Pause after key numbers (40%, 50%, 87%)
- Show enthusiasm when talking about results
- Serious tone for academic credibility

### Key Numbers to Emphasize:
- **40%** of plants die
- **50%** water waste
- **87%** health achieved
- **43%** water saved
- **40 years** PCSE validation
- **$52B** John Deere revenue

### Tone:
Professional but accessible, confident but not arrogant, technically sound but not jargon-heavy.
